    "advertisement_text": "I've invested more than a million pounds into this company Perfect Ted and they're also a sponsor of this podcast. I switched over to using matcha as my dominant energy source and that's where Perfect Ted comes in. They have the matcha powders, they have the matcha drinks, they have the pods and all of this keeps me focused throughout a very, very long recording day no matter what's going on and their team is obsessed with quality which is why they source their ceremonial grade matcha from Japan. So when people say to me that they don't like the taste of matcha I'm guessing that they haven't tried Perfect Ted. Unlike low-quality matcha that has a bitter grassy taste Perfect Ted is smooth and naturally sweet and without knowing it you're probably a Perfect Ted customer already if you're getting your matcha at places like blank Street or Joe and the juice but now you can make it yourself at home so give it a try and we'll see if you still don't like matcha. So here's what I'm going to do I'm going to give you 40% off your matcha if you try it today head to perfectted.com and use code st40 or if you're in a supermarket you can get it at tescos or Holland and Barrett or in the Netherlands at Albert Heijn and those of you in the US you can get it on Amazon.",
