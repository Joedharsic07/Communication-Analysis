    "advertisement_text": "now trading 212 is a fantastic app that allows you to invest in basically anything in a sensible fashion and there's a couple cool things about it firstly it's got like a practice mode where you can invest and trade with fake money so if you're new to the world of investing and you don't like the idea of like putting real money on the line you can invest with fake money and then it actually tracks what the markets are doing in real time so you can see how much money you would have made or you would have lost but my favorite part about it is that it makes it super easy to invest in index funds as you guys know if you've seen any of my videos about money I do not recommend trying to pick your own stocks but instead investing in Broad stock market index funds which have really low fees for example something like the S P 500 which basically gives you a small percentage ownership of the top 500 companies in the US now if you're based in the UK in particular you should definitely open up an Isa an individual savings account pounds and this is a tax-free wrapper where every year you can put up to twenty thousand pounds into one of these Isis and actually trading 212 have a new deal whereby if you open up an Isa and you put any amount of money into it they will give you one percent cash back on that money so you're literally making free money on top of the ISA so if you're based in the UK and you've been putting off opening an eye sell them this is the perfect time to do it either way whether you want to open an ISO or just a normal trading account you can head over to trading212.com or you can download the app on the App Store and if you use the coupon code Ali Ali when they ask you that will give you a free share which is worth up to 100 pounds so you're literally getting free money you might as well do it so thank you so much trading 212 for sponsoring this video",
