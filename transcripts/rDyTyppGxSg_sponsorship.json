    "advertisement_text": "One of the things that I think about all the time because my life is quite hectic and busy is how to manage my energy load and as a podcaster you kind of have to manage your energy in such a way that you can have these articulate conversations with experts on subjects you don't understand and this is why perfect Ted has become so important in my life because previously when it came to Energy Products I had to make a trade-off that I wasn't happy with typically if I wanted the energy I had to deal with high sugar I had to deal with Jitters and crashes that come along with a lot of the mainstream Energy Products and I also just had to tolerate the fact that if I want energy I have to put up with a lot of artificial ingredients which my body didn't like and that's why I invested in perfect Ted and why they're one of the sponsors of this podcast it has changed not just my life but my entire team's life and for me it's drastically improved my cognitive performance but also my physical performance so if you haven't tried perfect Ted yet you must have been living under a rock now is the time you can find perfect Ted at Tesco and waitrose or online where you can enjoy 40% off with code diary 40 at checkout head to perfect ted.com",
