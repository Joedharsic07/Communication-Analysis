    "advertisement_text": "you've heard me say this before thredup is one of my favorite ways to shop online they are an online consignment and thrift store they offer so many different styles every brand you can think of and obviously very amazing deals not only is it very user friendly in the way that you can search for things and find exactly what you want on the site my favorite part about thredup is that I can purchase things from brands that I already know that I love for obviously a very good discounted price and because everything is thrifted I feel like there's this built-in uniqueness and one-of-a-kind aspect that always comes with thrift shopping I feel like since I've been online thrift shopping more I've developed much more of a distinct personal style so with that said I'm going to show you guys some of the things that I am adding to my fall wardrobe this year everything from thredup including this sweater I'm going to show you how I styled it let's go off number one she's Gorge love this a little Disney fall moment so this sweater is from Zara and it has an estimated retail of 51 but I got it for 22.99 on thredup be ready to get sick of me wearing this because you're gonna see it a lot I also like that the fabric of this is still kind of light like it's not too thick that I'm gonna get very hot because I do live in California and California is Little Miss one season all year round so with this outfit I paired these stretchy plaid printed pants which are also very comfortable so these pants are from Urban Outfitters they have an estimated retail of 64. and I got them for 15.99 on threda thredup get out of here don't get out of here love you because these deals loving that like I just feel ready to go to like an apple orchard I also just paired this look with some white platform sneakers because I just moved and I don't know where any of my shoes are so this is what we're working with okay this one might be my favorite I am obsessed with this sweater I feel like it's very flattering as well I think it's the neckline it kind of is like a boat neck not really sure if that's what it is whatever it's gorgeous so this Michael Kors long sleeve has an estimated retail of 241 dollars and I got it on thredup for 58.99 and then I just paired it with this skirt it's like a little denim cut off skirt with little roses all over it
