If you've listened to me on this podcast for a while now, you'll know that I've been on a bit of an evolution as a business owner and entrepreneur, and one of those Evolutions that has become clearer and clearer as I've matured is that the single most important thing in building a business, in building a company, is hiring. The definition of the word company is actually a group of people, and that is the first responsibility and job that any entrepreneur has and should focus on. But surprisingly most don't. About 80% of my team have been hired from LinkedIn, and I think there's very few platforms, if any, in the world that could give you that diversity of candidate with that much information and data on their profiles. It usually costs money, but for the entrepreneurs that are listening to me, I've got you a free job ad post for your company on LinkedIn. Just go to linkedin.com/doac to post your free job ad today. That's linkedin.com/doac. Terms and conditions apply.",
