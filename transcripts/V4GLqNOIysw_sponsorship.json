    "advertisement_text": "I first want to talk about an at home laser treatment that I have been doing twice a day for the past 45 days and is the sponsor of today's video nerra thank you nerra for sponsoring this video you guys this might be the most excited I think I've ever been for a sponsorship for the past 45 days I have been using the Nero Pro Laser which is a non-fractional laser that helps to stimulate collagen production in the skin helped to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and helps to improve the overall texture and Radiance of the skin the reason I became so fascinated with Nera is because of the non-fractional Laser Technology in office provided by dermatologists there are non-fractional and fractional laser treatments that you can get done to resolve all those issues that I just explained collagen skin elasticity fine lines and the Nera uses precise Laser Technology to Target the dermis in a way that will help to increase collagen production without the pain or downtime that you oftentimes get in a clinical and office environment this in so many ways mirrors what you can get done in office but at a significantly less intense level which means that you can use the neural Laser Technology every single day for long-term results as opposed to really intense painful and very expensive in office treatments now the the Pro Laser is FDA cleared and there's clinical studies to show that it helps to minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles in the face but unlike a Retinol Serum or exfoliating product it uses non-fractional lasers to Target the skin at a deeper level to increase that collagen production and I want to talk about my experience and results because I have been absolutely blown away to the point that I'm like I am going to use this every single day for the rest of my life over the past month of using this I had not seen my best friend for a month who I'm used to seeing him like every single day obviously the skin takes a while to regenerate itself so I wasn't expecting any mind-blowing differences within just a month but once I saw him again the first thing he told me was Iram you look younger what have you been doing this is someone I've known for the past 10 years and is always ready to make a joke about my aging skin and for him to say I look younger when the only thing I've been doing differently is using this he immediately wanted to start using the device and that's when for me I was like oh this works the technology is actually effective now as someone who has very reactive skin and tends to get very red the burn I have never noticed any redness sensitivity or irritation after using the device even at the strongest level when using the device it heats up the skin but by the third day of using it I already increased it to the highest intensity with no discomfort or pain I start my day by using the Nero Pro on my freshly clean dry skin and one thing I love about it and I think the reason I have been able to maintain using it twice a day is that it's so quick and easy to use my entire face takes about 5 minutes and then I'm done now because of our Skin's regeneration timeline it typically takes about 60 to 90 days of continued use to notice optimal results but as I've use this twice a day I've noticed that my skin just looks more bouncy more hydrated more refreshed and of course I do want to say an at home laser device by no means will compare to the results that you can get from an intense and office treatment provided by a dermatologist that has downtime however the N device is amazing for getting that daily laser treatment and maintaining the health of your skin while also preventing long-term deep set damage that an in-office treatment would Target and as you'll see later in the video it is a fraction of the cost that you would be paying for regular in office laser treatments I think near Laser Technology is so fascinating and such a great way of maintaining the health of your skin and getting that daily treatment that can help to prevent unnecessary long-term damage that you would need to dish out thousands and thousands of dollars for down the road it's a great maintenance and preventative step to ensure the health of your skin while getting those laser results if you want to learn more about the Nero Laser Pro device as well as their other devices I will have their links in the description box below and all the rest of the information there for you to start your at home laser journey",
