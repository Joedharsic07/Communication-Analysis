    "advertisement_text": "one of my favorite new tools that I'm experimenting a lot with for scheduling my time intentionally is reclaim.  It automatically help build out your ideal week without spending more time in Google Calendar it also automatically reschedules stuff if you have any calendar conflicts which means you can stay flexible while hopefully making sure you never actually drop the ball now there are three features in particular that I've been playing a lot with recently firstly is the habits feature so these are daily non-negotiables that I want reclaimed to put in my calendar each day they've also got a really interesting tasks feature so essentially it's like a to-do list but you can Define tasks in different priorities and then based on the priority and the deadline and how much time the task will take it will automatically time block the task for you and then if you manage to do the task it goes off the list but if you don't manage to do the task in that time it will block it to another time based on like the AI algorith me thing and then the other nice thing is that reclaim can also add automatic flexible buffer times into your schedule in between stuff so if for example I have a personal trainer session after a meeting then it will automatically know that and it will figure out how much buffer time to put in my calendar reclaim also has a Time tracking feature that shows you how you're spending your time and personally me and my team are big advocates for time tracking so that you can really have that awareness of oh crap you know this is where I'm spending my time and this is where I want to be spending my time so if you're looking for a way to level up your time management game without spending more time fiddling around Google Calendar then I would recommend checking out reclaim and very excitingly you can get an extended 30-day trial of all the premium features when you sign up to the free plan with my link reclaimd that'll be linked down below as well it's a cool tool I'd recommend trying it out and seeing if it fits within your workflow so thank you so much reclaim for sponsoring this video",
